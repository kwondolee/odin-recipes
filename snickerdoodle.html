    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of margarine, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons real maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup more white sugar to make sure you get diabetes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of maple sugar for good measure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and 1 cup of white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and maple syrup.
             Gradually blend in the dry ingredients until just mixed. In a small dish, mix together the remaining 1/2 cup white sugar and the maple sugar. Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and roll the balls in the sugar mixture. Place cookies 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies will be crackly on top and look wet in the middle. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.</li>
    </ol>
